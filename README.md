## About the OpenReblock Project

OpenReblock is an interactive mapping tool to facilitate community-driven planning in slums. The tool relies on data from [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and interdisciplinary urban science techniques to diagnose infrastructure deficits and propose new street networks to enhance spatial accessibility and lay the groundwork for further improvements like street enumerations, clean water and sanitation infrastructure, and increased tenure security.

### Why make an urban planning tool? 
The world is urbanizing quickly with nearly 4 billion people presently living in urban areas, about 1 billion of them in slums without access to plumbing, electricity, or basic city services. Rapid urbanization creates a need to rethink how urban planning happens by putting open source tools in the hands of communities to speed up the process and democratize the resources needed to inform better solutions. The current challenge -- which we are hoping you may be able to help with -- is to help develop this urban planning toolkit.

### Why develop it using R Shiny? 
Compared to other web development frameworks R Shiny has a relatively low learning curve allowing people across a range of disciplines and skill levels to contribute, quickly iterate, and work towards a toolkit that can work at scale and across a variety of contexts. Developing a viable urban planning tool is an incredibly complex task and it will require a large, interdisciplinary community. The solution must combine knowledge of UX design, civil engineering, urban planning, architecture, earth science, GIS, social science, and mathematics. R Shiny is an excellent way for this community of students, volunteers, practitioners, and researchers across the globe to use their knowledge and expertise to build a user-friendly planning tool to empower slum-dwellers.

### Ok, how can I get involved? 
Open a pull request! Below we’ve developed a set of modules that focus on discrete urban planning challenges in slums and describe how one might add a feature to address the issue and incorporate it into the tool. While the initial version of OpenReblock only maps a few areas, extracts vector data, and runs a prototype version of the reblocking algorithm, the hope is to incrementally add modular features to the tool to enable slum-dwellers and urban planners to re-plan and integrate slums and informal neighborhoods in a holistic manner with minimal disturbance and cost.
